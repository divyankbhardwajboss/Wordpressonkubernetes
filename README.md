Setting up a MySQL database
The first step in deploying a WordPress website is to set up a MySQL database. To set up a MySQL database in Kubernetes, we will create a Kubernetes deployment and service.

Create a file called mysql-deployment.yaml and add the following contents:


This YAML file creates a deployment and service for the MySQL database. It uses the official MySQL Docker image and sets the MySQL root password and database name using environment variables. It also creates a persistent volume claim to store the MySQL data.

To create the MySQL deployment and service, run the following command:

$ kubectl apply -f mysql-deployment.yaml

Setting up WordPress with Docker Compose
Now that we have a MySQL database running in Kubernetes, we can set up WordPress using Docker Compose. Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.

Create a file called docker-compose.yaml and add the following contents:


This YAML file creates two services:

db: This service uses the official MySQL Docker image and sets the MySQL root password and database name using environment variables. It also creates a volume for storing the MySQL data.

wordpress: This service uses the official WordPress Docker image and sets the database hostname, username, password, and database name using environment variables. It also creates a volume for storing the WordPress content.

To start the WordPress and MySQL containers using Docker Compose, run the following command:

$ docker-compose up -d

Creating a Docker image for WordPress
Now that we have WordPress running with Docker Compose, we can create a Docker image for WordPress that includes all the required plugins, themes, and configuration.

Create a file called Dockerfile in the root directory of your WordPress installation and add the following contents:



This Dockerfile installs the required PHP extensions and copies the custom configuration files. It also sets the entrypoint to a custom script that runs the required database migrations and configurations.

Create a file called custom-entrypoint.sh in the root directory of your WordPress installation and add the following contents:

This script waits for the database to be ready, runs the required database migrations, and configures the WordPress settings. It also activates the required plugins and themes.

To build the Docker image, run the following command:

$ docker build -t your-registry/your-image:latest .

Replace your-registry and your-image with your Docker registry and image name.

Deploying WordPress to Kubernetes
Now that we have a Docker image for WordPress, we can deploy it to Kubernetes.

Create a file called wordpress-deployment.yaml and add the following contents:



This YAML file defines a Deployment and a Service for WordPress. The Deployment specifies the container image and environment variables, and also mounts the wordpress-content volume. The Service exposes the WordPress container using a LoadBalancer.

Create a file called mysql-deployment.yaml and add the following contents:



This YAML file defines a Deployment and a Service for MySQL. The Deployment specifies the container image and environment variables, and also mounts the mysql-data volume. The Service exposes the MySQL container using a ClusterIP.

Create a file called wordpress-content-pvc.yaml and add the following contents:



This YAML file defines a PersistentVolumeClaim for storing the WordPress content.

Create a file called mysql-data-pvc.yaml and add the following contents:



This YAML file defines a PersistentVolumeClaim for storing the MySQL data.

Finally, we need to apply the YAML files to our Kubernetes cluster. Run the following commands in your terminal:

$ kubectl apply -f wordpress-config.yaml
$ kubectl apply -f wordpress-deployment.yaml
$ kubectl apply -f mysql-deployment.yaml
$ kubectl apply -f wordpress-content-pvc.yaml
$ kubectl apply -f mysql-data-pvc.yaml
This will create the necessary Kubernetes objects for deploying WordPress using Docker.

Once the objects have been created, you can check their status by running the following commands:

$ kubectl get configmap wordpress
$ kubectl get secret mysql
$ kubectl get pvc
$ kubectl get deployment
$ kubectl get pod
$ kubectl get service
If everything is working correctly, you should see output that indicates the objects are running and available.

To access WordPress, you can use the external IP address of the WordPress service. You can get this address by running the following command:

$ kubectl get service wordpress
This will output the external IP address of the WordPress service. You can use this IP address to access WordPress in your web browser.
